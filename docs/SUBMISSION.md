# HMS Project

The submition is taged as version 0.1.0 and in case you are checking the project after 29/06/21 then I would recomend checking the master branch.

The tools used in this project:
* [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [dotnet v5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [github](https://github.com)
* [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [draw.io](draw.io)

The project is not yet complete and has quite a lot of work to be done on it,

The main things needed for implementation are the serialazaition of the objects to json which in dotnet v5 is now built in and is not dependent on the serialization architecture of Newtonsoft.Json

In the future I would like to implement the system through an api instead of an consule app.

### Have Fun :)
